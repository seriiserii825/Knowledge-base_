Manipulating tabs:

    J, gT      go one tab left
    K, gt      go one tab right
    g0         go to the first tab
    g$         go to the last tab
    t          create tab
    x          close current tab
    X          restore closed tab (i.e. unwind the 'x' command)
    T          search through your open tabs

Additional advanced browsing commands:

    ]]      Follow the link labeled 'next' or '>'. Helpful for browsing paginated sites.
    [[      Follow the link labeled 'previous' or '<'. Helpful for browsing paginated sites.
    <a-f>   open multiple links in a new tab
    gi      focus the first (or n-th) text input box on the page
    gu      go up one level in the URL hierarchy

Vimium supports command repetition so, for example, hitting '5t' will open 5 tabs in rapid succession. ESC (or <c-[>) will clear any partial commands in the queue and will also exit insert and find modes.
