```

Using the `post meta get` command we can look at this serialized options array for the `_mail meta_key`

```bash
wp post meta get 300 _mail --allow-root
```


### Accessing Serialized postmeta with WP-CLI

As of WP-CLI 1.4.0 it is now possible to access and modify WordPress options and meta stored in a serialized array with the `pluck` and `patch` commands!

wp post meta pluck syntax takes this form

```bash
wp post meta pluck <ID> <key> <key-name>
```

Using post\_id `300` as the `<ID>`, `_mail` as the `<key>` and the `<key-name>` as `use_html`, the command looks like this

```bash
wp post meta pluck 300 _mail use_html --allow-root
```


Now we can update these values with the patch command whose syntax looks like this.

```
wp post meta patch update <ID> <key> <key-name> <value>
```

Using post\_id `300` as the `<ID>`, `_mail` as the `<key>` and the `<key-name>` as `use_html`Â with the `1` as `value`, the command looks like this

```bash
wp post meta patch update 300 _mail use_html 1 --allow-root
```

### Scripting with WP-CLI

In this simple bash script we create an array of all the Contact Form 7 `post_ids`.

Then we use the `post meta patch` command to update each programatically via a for loop through the array.

```bash
POSTIDLIST=($(wp post list --post_type=wpcf7_contact_form --field=ID --allow-root))

for POSTID in ${POSTIDLIST[@]}; do
    wp post meta patch update ${POSTID} _mail use_html 1 --allow-root
done
```
